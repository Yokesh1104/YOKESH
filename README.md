Liver diseases are among the most difficult to detect early because they have no visible 
symptoms. This paper discusses the application of machine learning techniques in predicting 
liver diseases using the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD). The dataset was preprocessed by 
data cleaning, balancing, and scaling to ensure the quality and reliability of the input features. 
Feature selection techniques were applied to determine the most significant attributes that affect 
the prediction of liver disease, thus improving the overall performance. These different 
machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNearest Neighbors, 
Random Forest, and XGBoost were applied for effective data classification. Ensemble learning 
was also used along with stacking for more accurate predictions by the strength of many 
models. It tried to have a more powerful and reliable system of prediction as opposed to any 
single model-based approach. The results show that machine learning can make predictions 
that are valid, hence the importance in disease diagnosis and, by implication, treatment plan. A 
contribution of this research toward improving the health care technology interface is how 
advanced algorithms and ensemble methods have been developed within this study.
